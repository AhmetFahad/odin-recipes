        <p style="text-align: left">This is my mom's simple and easy recipe for sushi rice. Can be modified to your taste.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul style="text-indent: 10px;">
            <li>2 ¼ cups Japanese sushi-style rice</li>
            <li>1 (4 inch) piece konbu dried kelp (Optional)</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>STEP 1:<br>
                Place rice into a large, deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice together with hands until water turns milky white. Pour off cloudy water, being careful not to pour out rice. Repeat 3 or 4 times until you can see rice through 3 inches of water.
            </li>
            <li>STEP 2:<br>
                Drain rice in a fine strainer, then place into a saucepan along with konbu and 3 cups water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes. Stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved in a small bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>STEP 3:<br>
                Cover, and bring rice to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>STEP 4:<br>
                Scrape rice into a bowl; remove and discard konbu. Stir in vinegar mixture until well incorporated and no lumps of rice remain. Allow to cool at room temperature. For a shinier appearance, use an electric fan to cool rice rapidly.
